Base Model
==============
Details about the original Covasim model are available at http://paper.covasim.org. This README will focus on the features unique to this fork. 
These files include students.py and all files ending in Campus (e.g., simCampus.py).


====================
Major New Features
====================
To utilize the added features in this fork, the user must implement the simulation using a SimCampus object. The SimCampus class works in roughly
the same manner as the parent Sim class but currently assumes that each individual's age is uniformly distributed between 18 and 22. It also adds
a new data member called dorms, which is an array of Dorm objects (see below). The Dorm objects help to manage the contact networks in a SimCampus
object. The contact layers for these networks are roommate contacts ('r'), bathroom contacts ('b'), floor contacts ('f'), and community contacts ('c'). 

The contact networks rely on nested pools. Each individual has a contact with their roommate every day. Then, some number of bathroom contacts are 
randomly selected from a pool of possible individuals. A bathroom pool is composed of all sets of roommates for some number of rooms. Similarly, floor
contacts are sampled from a pool that joins together some number of bathroom pools. Finally, community contacts are sampled from a pool of every 
individual in the model.
NOTE: The contacts simulation parameter is parameterized differently from the original Covasim. Here, the values represent the number of contact
    *events* per agent. This means that these values in a SimCampus implementation will be half that of the equivalent in the original Covasim.


A set of Dorm objects records the contact structure for one housing unit. It's constructor takes three arguments. The first is the number of individuals
in a room, the second argument is an array where each element is the number of rooms using the same bathroom, and the third argument is an array where
each element is the number of bathrooms per floor.
